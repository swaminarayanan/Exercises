Month-wise Latitudinal Temperature Fluctuations
This study includes an assessment of annual temperature fluctuations across different regions â€” namely, the tropics, subtropics, and extratropical zones.
It aims to detect whether the atmospheric conditions are suitable for triggering convection, based on specific criteria.
Using three different land surface scenarios, the study evaluates surface heat fluxes, specifically latent heat and sensible heat fluxes.
